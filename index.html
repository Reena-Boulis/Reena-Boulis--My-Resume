        <p class="lead mb-4"></p><br>Hello. My name is Reena Boulis. I am 18 years of age, in attendance at University of California: Riverside. Here, I am majoring in political science. I hope to major in political science/law and society once I am a junior, as it is only offered to juniors and above. I come from an immigrant family, and I am a first generation college student. My parents fled from Iraq due to the persecution of Christians, and they raised me here where I would be safe. I have one younger sister, and no pets. I used to own fish, but sadly they have passed on. I have loads of cousins, most of whom I donâ€™t get to see, but some who I interact with regularly. I am Middle Eastern, specifically from Iraq. Although I was born here, I still stay in touch with my deep heritage and my roots. I am a practicing Catholic; I go to church at St. George Chaldean Catholic Church. I was raised in Brea, California, and attended school first at Mariposa Elementary. Then, I went to Brea Junior High, and finally, Brea Olinda High School, where I was a part of the graduating class of 2020. In high school, I was a part of Marching Band for 4 years, where I was captain of the drumline my senior year. I also did Mock Trial, and was also captain there. I made many great friends and memories.<br>

        I am at college to earn a degree in political science, in pursuit of being a lawyer. I plan on going to law school after I graduate from University of California: Riverside. I want to be a lawyer because I want to make a difference in this world and help deliver justice to those who have been wronged and beaten down by the system and criminals. I hope to do good and make the world a better place as best as I can, even if I am just one mere person. My experience in mock trial not only at high school but also at a summer camp in Yale University has driven my passion to become a lawyer and refine my craft of the work. I enjoyed the experiences I had and wish to pursue this as a lifelong career, despite the hardships, years of schooling, and extensive amounts of money it will cost me to become educated enough to qualify. 
<br><br>

        I have learned a great many things about being an efficient worker. In my leadership experiences, I have learned not only the importance of leadership and management, but the importance of dutiful team members and workers. Without them, the organization crumbles. I have learned to be time efficient, inquisitive, responsible, and intuitive. It is important for every individual to put in their work, and because I know this, I work very hard no matter how small the role in the group may be. It takes good communication and good people skills as well, which I have, as I enjoy public speaking and socialization.
